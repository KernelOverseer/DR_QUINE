## What is a Quine?

In the realm of computer programming, a **Quine** refers to a fascinating and mind-bending program that has the extraordinary ability to generate its own complete source code as its output. It is essentially a self-replicating piece of code, capable of reproducing itself without any external input.

Quines are an intriguing concept in computer science and hold a special place among programming enthusiasts and language theoreticians. They often serve as intriguing puzzles and challenges, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of programming.

## How does a Quine work?

The main goal of a Quine is to produce an output that is exactly identical to its own source code. This task might sound deceptively simple, but it becomes an intriguing challenge due to the constraints imposed on the program:

1. **No Input**: Quines must not take any input from external sources during their execution. Their self-replication must solely rely on their inherent logic.

2. **No File Access**: Quines typically cannot read their own source code from a file, making the task even more complex.

3. **Fixed Output**: The Quine must not be allowed to print any constant strings that explicitly represent its source code. The self-replication must occur through programmatic means.

4. **Language Restrictions**: Quines often come with additional language-specific constraints, adding an extra layer of difficulty to the challenge.

## Let's Explore the Quine Project

This repository contains an implementation of a Quine in the programming languages C, ASM and Python. The Quine program is designed to demonstrate the self-replication phenomenon and exemplify the elegance of the concept.

## Try it Yourself!

Feel free to explore the code in this repository and run the Quine program to witness the self-replication magic in action. You can examine the source code and see how the program ingeniously produces an output that matches its own code.
